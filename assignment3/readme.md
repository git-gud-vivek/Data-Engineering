## Python OOP Assignment

__Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?__
```
The main purpose of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.
OOP concepts are:-
-class
-object
-Polymorphism
-Inheritance
-Encapsulation
-Data abstraction
```

__Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?__
```
 An inheritance search looks for an attribute first in the instance object, 
 then in the class the instance was created from, then in all higher superclasses, progressing from left to right (by default). 
 The search stops at the first place the attribute is found.
